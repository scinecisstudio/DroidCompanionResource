    <h2>Data Collection</h2>

    <p>Device Info does not collect user confidential data. The only data collected by the device info are the device
        Model and the device manufacturer. We use these data to detect the chipset, device name, CPU architecture,
        memory type, and bandwidth, etc. We do not collect personal information such as email addresses, your name,
        address, etc. Also, we have integrated the Google Firebase platform. So firebase will collect the data for it to
        work.</p>

    <h2>Data collected by third-party SDK</h2>

    <p>The third-party SDK we use:</p>
    <b>Google Firebase</b>
    <b>Google Play Services</b>
    <p>These SDKs may collect your data, including Google advertising ID, advertising data (advertisement display,
        clicks, etc.), data used to combat fraud, cookies, device-related data (device model, region, language, etc.)
